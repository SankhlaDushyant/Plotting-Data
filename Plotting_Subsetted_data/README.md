Question  1: Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
Answer 1: Yes, they sharply declined from 1999 to 2002. Then a slower decline between 2002 and 2005. Finally, they sharply declined from 2005 to 2008.

Question 2: Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the Baltimore City, Maryland (𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == "𝟸𝟺𝟻𝟷𝟶") from 1999 to 2008? Use the base plotting system to make a plot answering this question.
Answer : The data indicate a sharp decline between 1999 and 2002. A sharp increase occurred from 2002 to 2005. Finally, another sharp decrease occurred from 2005 to 2008.

Question 3: Of the four types of sources indicated by the 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.
Answer  : Nonpoint (green bar): From the plot, we see that nonpoint (green bar) sharply decreased from 1999 to 2002. It remained steady from 2002 to 2005. Finally, a slight decrease occurred between 2005 and 2008.
Point (purple bar): From the plot, we see that the point (purple bar) slightly increased from 1999 to 2002. It then sharply increased in from 2002 to 2005. Finally, from 2005 to 2008 sharply decreased.
Onroad (blue bar): From the plot, we see that the onroad (blue bar) slightly decreased from 1999 to 2002. It remained approximately steady from 2002 to 2005 and  then slightly decreased from from 2005 to 2008. In comparison to the nonroad values.
Nonroad (red bar): From the plot, we see that the nonroad (red bar) followed the same path as the onroad values only slightly higher in emissions values. slightly decreased from 1999 to 2002. It remained approximately steady from 2002 to 2005 and then slightly decreased from 2005 to 2008.

Question 4: Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?
Answer : They sharply declined from 1999 to 2002 and between 2002 and 2005. Finally, they slowly declined from 2005 to 2008.

Question 5: How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?
Answer : Starting with 1999, the levels fell sharply until 2002. From 2002 to 2005 the levels plateaued. Finally from 2005 to 2008 it dropped slightly.

Question 6 : Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in Los Angeles County, California (𝚏𝚒𝚙𝚜 == "𝟶𝟼𝟶𝟹𝟽"). Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?
Answer : Baltimore, MD [city] (Red bar): Between 1999 and 2002, it slowly declines and remains nearly static between 2002 and 2008.
Los Angeles, CA [county] (Blue bar): The blue line starts significantly higher than the Baltimore, MD line. Starting with 1999, steadily increases to 2005 and then decreases between 2005 and 2008.
